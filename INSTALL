Requirements
------------

  Python 2.2 or later.

  You'll want to have a NetWorkSpaces server installed and running on
  some machine that you can connect to, but it doesn't need to be
  installed on a client machine.


Unix Installation (including Linux and Mac OS/X)
------------------------------------------------

  First, untar and build the distribution:

      % tar xzvf python-nws-1.X.Y.tar.gz
      % python setup.py build

  You can do this as an unprivileged user, even if you plan to install
  it as root.

  Note that on Debian systems, you need to install the python-dev
  package in order to install python source distributions.


System Installation
-------------------

  To do a system wide installation, su to root, and execute the
  following command:

      # python setup.py install

  This will add the nws python package to your python installation, and
  copy several scripts to  a directory such as /usr/bin.  You should
  make a note of what that directory is, so you can add it to your PATH
  environment variable if necessary.


Private Installation
--------------------

  To do a private installation, say into your home directory, you can
  execute the following command:

      % python setup.py install --home $HOME

  This will copy the nws python package to the directory:

      $HOME/lib/python

  You may want to put this directory into your PYTHONPATH environment
  variable so that python will be able to find it.

  Several scripts will be copied to your $HOME/bin directory.
